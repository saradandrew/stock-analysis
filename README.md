# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to use Microsoft VBA to loop through a dataset that includes entire stock market data from the past few years. Our findings will be used to compare stock performance between 2017 and 2018.

## Results
From this analysis, we found that overall stock performance was better in 2017 than in 2018. Also, the refactored scripts ran faster than the original script by approximately 2 seconds.

## Summary
In conclusion, a worthwhile advantage of refactoring code is faster execution times while a disadvantage may be that it could be time consuming. We see this advantage and disadvantage in this instance - it took more time to go back and refactor the code. However, this refactor ultimately resulted in faster execution times.
